# js_automation_scripts
some automationscripts to automate web processes


--- This script is explicitly used for a specific website. To use it for your website, you must change inpputField and addButton with the ids of inputField and Button. ---

Usecase: With this script you can split a bunch of words seperated by a ',' into seperate parts and select a button.

This can be used for example if you hava a a bunch of words seperated by a ',' and need to add each word seperately to an input field and add them by clicking on a button.

This script easily adds each word seperately instead of adding the whole text. It seperates each word and clicks the button for the word.
